Section 3: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning with Python
Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are two important fields in computer science. AI refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as recognizing speech or images. ML is a subset of AI that involves using algorithms to learn patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on that data.

Machine Learning basics (e.g., supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning)
Machine Learning can be categorized into several types, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

Supervised learning involves using labeled data to train a model to make predictions on new, unseen data. For example, you might train a model to recognize images of cats and dogs based on a dataset of labeled images.

Unsupervised learning involves using unlabeled data to discover patterns or structure in the data. For example, you might use unsupervised learning to identify groups of customers based on their purchasing behavior.

Reinforcement learning involves training a model to make decisions based on feedback or rewards. For example, you might train a model to play a game based on the rewards it receives for different actions.

Introduction to Scikit-Learn for Machine Learning

Sorry about that, here's the rest of the tutorial:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Read data from CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data[['column1', 'column2']], data['target_column'], test_size=0.2)

# Train a linear regression model on the training data
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Use the model to make predictions on the testing data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the mean squared error of the predictions
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print('Mean Squared Error:', mse)
Introduction to Deep Learning with TensorFlow
Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that involves using neural networks to learn from data. TensorFlow is a popular Python library for building and training neural networks. Here's an example:

python
Copy code
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple neural network with one hidden layer
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(2,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model with a binary crossentropy loss function and Adam optimizer
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model on some data
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

# Plot the training and validation accuracy over time
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='Training Accuracy')
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='Validation Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
Introduction to Automation with Python
Python can also be used for automation, such as automating repetitive tasks or creating scripts to perform specific actions. Here are a few examples:

python
Copy code
import os

# List all files in a directory and print their names
for file in os.listdir('directory_path'):
    print(file)

# Rename all files in a directory with a specific extension
for file in os.listdir('directory_path'):
    if file.endswith('.txt'):
        os.rename(file, file[:-4] + '_new.txt')

# Send an email using the built-in smtplib library
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

msg = MIMEText('Hello, this is a test email')
msg['Subject'] = 'Test Email'
msg['From'] = 'sender_email'
msg['To'] = 'recipient_email'

server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
server.starttls()
server.login('sender_email', 'password')
server.sendmail('sender_email', 'recipient_email', msg.as_string())
server.quit()
